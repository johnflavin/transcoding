# Transcoding

A couple scripts to help me do my video transcoding workflow.

Based on:

* Don Melton's video transcoding scripts: [donmelton/video_transcoding](https://github.com/donmelton/video_transcoding)
* NTodd's docker image for the scripts: [ntodd/video_transcoding_docker](https://github.com/ntodd/video_transcoding_docker)

Currently a work in progress.
